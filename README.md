Forward engineer a SQL script in MySQLWorkbench and query the sample data set in MySQL

In this project, I have built a sample dataset describing school clubs. All data is test data (made up data). 

There are six tables: students, clubs, members, president, secretary, and treasurer. The SQL script to create and populate the tables was forward engineered on MySQLWorkbench.
